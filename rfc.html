		 	Datagrams on Avian Carriers </h1>

			<section id="section_1_1149" role="region">
			 	<h2> Status of this Memo </h2>
				<p>
					This memo describes an experimental method for the encapsulation of
					<abbr title="Intenet Protocol"> IP </abbr>
					datagrams in avian carriers.  This specification is primarily
					useful in Metropolitan Area Networks.  This is an experimental, not
					recommended standard.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section id="section_2_1149" role="region">
				<h2> Overview and Rational </h2>
				<p>
					Avian carriers can provide high delay, low throughput, and low
					altitude service.  The connection topology is limited to a single
					point-to-point path for each carrier, used with standard carriers,
					but many carriers can be used without significant interference with
					each other, outside of early spring.  This is because of the 3D ether
					space available to the carriers, in contrast to the 1D ether used by
					IEEE802.3.  The carriers have an intrinsic collision avoidance
					system, which increases availability.  Unlike some network
					technologies, such as packet radio, communication is not limited to
					line-of-sight distance.  Connection oriented service is available in
					some cities, usually based upon a central hub topology.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section id="section_3_1149" role="region">
				<h2> Frame Format </h2>
				<p>
					The IP datagram is printed, on a small scroll of paper, in
					hexadecimal, with each octet separated by whitestuff and blackstuff.
					The scroll of paper is wrapped around one leg of the avian carrier.
					A band of duct tape is used to secure the datagram's edges.  The
					bandwidth is limited to the leg length.  
					The <abbr title="Maximum Transmission Unit"> MTU </abbr> is variable, and
					paradoxically, generally increases with increased carrier age.  A
					typical <abbr title="Maximum Transmission Unit"> MTU </abbr> is 256 milligrams.  
					Some datagram padding may be needed.
					Upon receipt, the duct tape is removed and the paper copy of the
					datagram is optically scanned into a electronically transmittable
					form.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section id="section_4_1149" role="region">
				<h2> Discussion </h2>		
				<p>
					Multiple types of service can be provided with a prioritized pecking
					order.  An additional property is built-in worm detection and
					eradication.  Because <abbr title="Intenet Protocol"> IP </abbr> only guarantees best effort delivery, loss
					of a carrier can be tolerated.  With time, the carriers are self-regenerating.
					While broadcasting is not specified, storms can cause
					data loss.  There is persistent delivery retry, until the carrier
					drops.  Audit trails are automatically generated, and can often be
					found on logs and cable trays.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section id="section_5_1149" role="region">
				<h2> Security Considerations </h2>
				<p>
					Security is not generally a problem in normal operation, but special
					measures must be taken (such as data encryption) when avian carriers
					are used in a tactical environment.

				<h2> Overview and Rational </h2>		
				<p>
					The following quality of service levels are available: Concorde,
					First, Business, and Coach.  Concorde class offers expedited data
					delivery.  One major benefit to using Avian Carriers is that this is
					the only networking technology that earns frequent flyer miles, plus
					the Concorde and First classes of service earn 50% bonus miles per
					packet.  Ostriches are an alternate carrier that have much greater
					bulk transfer capability but provide slower delivery, and require the
					use of bridges between domains.

					The service level is indicated on a per-carrier basis by bar-code
					markings on the wing.  One implementation strategy is for a bar-code
					reader to scan each carrier as it enters the router and then enqueue
					it in the proper queue, gated to prevent exit until the proper time.
					The carriers may sleep while enqueued.
				</p>
				<p>
					For secure networks, carriers may have classes Prime or Choice.
					Prime carriers are self-keying when using public key encryption.
					Some distributors have been known to falsely classify Choice carriers
					as Prime.
					Packets MAY be marked for deletion using RED paint while enqueued.
					Weighted fair queueing (WFQ) MAY be implemented using scales, as
   					shown:
   				</p>
   					<img src="img/WFQ.png" alt="">
   				<p>
   					Carriers in the queue too long may leave log entries, as shown on the
				   scale.

				   The following is a plot of traffic shaping, from coop-erative host
				   sites.
				</p>
				  	<img src="img/PlotOfTraffic.png" alt="">
		
				<p>
					Avian carriers normally bypass bridges and tunnels but will seek out
					worm hole tunnels.  When carrying web traffic, the carriers may
					digest the spiders, leaving behind a more compact representation.
					The carriers may be confused by mirrors.

					Round-robin queueing is not recommended.  Robins make for well-tuned
					networks but do not support the necessary auto-homing feature.

					A BOF was held at the last <abbr title="Internet Engineering Task Force"> IETF </abbr> 
					but only Avian Carriers were allowed entry, so we don't know the results 
					other than we're sure they think <abbr title="MultiProtocol Label Switching"> MPLS </abbr> is great.  
					Our attempts at attaching labels to the carriers have been met with resistance.

					<abbr title="Network Address Translation"> NATs </abbr> are not recommended either 
					-- as with many protocols, modifying the brain-embedded IP addresses is difficult, 
					plus Avian Carriers MAY eat the NATs. Encapsulation may be done with saran wrappers.  
				</p>
				<p>	
					Unintentional encapsulation in hawks has been known to occur, with 
					decapsulation being messy and the packets mangled.

					Loose source routes are a viable evolutionary alternative enhanced
					standards-based MSWindows-compliant technology, but strict source
					routes MUST NOT be used, as they are a choke-point.

					The <abbr title="International Telecommunication Union"> ITU </abbr> 
					has offered the IETF formal alignment with its corresponding
					technology, Penguins, but that won't fly.

					Multicasting is supported, but requires the implementation of a clone
					device.  Carriers may be lost if they are based on a tree as it is
					being pruned.  The carriers propagate via an inheritance tree.  The
					carriers have an average TTL of 15 years, so their use in expanding
					ring searches is limited.

					Additional quality of service discussion can be found in a Michelin's
					guide.

				<h2> 1. Introduction </h2>
				<p>
					As shown by [RFC6036], many service providers are actively planning
					to deploy IPv6 to alleviate the imminent shortage of IPv4 addresses.
					This will affect all service providers who have implemented
					[RFC1149].  It is therefore necessary, indeed urgent, to specify a
					method of transmitting IPv6 datagrams [RFC2460] over the RFC 1149
					medium, rather than obliging those service providers to migrate to a
					different medium.  This document offers such a specification.

				<p>
					The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
					"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
					document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
				</p>
			</section>

			<section id="section_6_6214" role="region">
				<h2> 3.	Detailed Specification </h2>
				<p>
					Unless otherwise stated, the provisions of [RFC1149] and [RFC2460]
					apply throughout.
				</p>

				<h3 id="section_6_1_6214"> 3.1. Maximum Transmission Unit </h3>
				<p>
					As noted in RFC 1149, the <abbr title="Maximum Transmission Unit"> MTU </abbr> 
					is variable, and generally increases with increased carrier age.  
					Since the minimum link MTU allowed by RFC 2460 is 1280 octets, 
					this means that older carriers MUST be used for IPv6.  
					RFC 1149 does not provide exact conversion factors between
					age and milligrams, or between milligrams and octets.  
					These conversion factors are implementation dependent, but as an
					illustrative example, we assume that the 256 milligram MTU suggested
					in RFC 1149 corresponds to an MTU of 576 octets.  In that case, the
					typical MTU for the present specification will be at least
					256*1280/576, which is approximately 569 milligrams.  Again as an
					illustrative example, this is likely to require a carrier age of at
					least 365 days.

					Furthermore, the MTU issues are non-linear with carrier age.  That
					is, a young carrier can only carry small payloads, an adult carrier
					can carry jumbograms [RFC2675], and an elderly carrier can again
					carry only smaller payloads.  There is also an effect on transit time
					depending on carrier age, affecting bandwidth-delay product and hence
					the performance of <abbr title="Transmission Control Protocol"> TCP </abbr>.
				</p>

				<h3 id="section_6_2_6214" > 3.2. Frame Format </h3>
				<p>
					RFC 1149 does not specify the use of any link layer tag such as an
					Ethertype or, worse, an OSI Link Layer or SNAP header [RFC1042].
					Indeed, header snaps are known to worsen the quality of service
					provided by RFC 1149 carriers.  In the interests of efficiency and to
					avoid excessive energy consumption while packets are in flight
					through the network, no such link layer tag is required for IPv6
					packets either.  The frame format is therefore a pure IPv6 packet as
					defined in [RFC2460], encoded and decoded as defined in [RFC1149].

					One important consequence of this is that in a dual-stack deployment
					[RFC4213], the receiver MUST inspect the IP protocol version number
					in the first four bits of every packet, as the only means to
					demultiplex a mixture of IPv4 and IPv6 packets.
				</p>

				<h3 id="section_6_3_6214" > 3.3. Address Configuration </h3>
				<p>
					The lack of any form of link layer protocol means that link-local
					addresses cannot be formed, as there is no way to address anything
					except the other end of the link.

					Similarly, there is no method to map an IPv6 unicast address to a
					link layer address, since there is no link layer address in the first
					place.  IPv6 Neighbor Discovery [RFC4861] is therefore impossible.

					Implementations SHOULD NOT even try to use stateless address auto-
					configuration [RFC4862].  This recommendation is because this
					mechanism requires a stable interface identifier formed in a way
					compatible with [RFC4291].  Unfortunately the transmission elements
					specified by RFC 1149 are not generally stable enough for this and
					may become highly unstable in the presence of a cross-wind.
					In most deployments, either the end points of the link remain
					unnumbered, or a /127 prefix and static addresses MAY be assigned.
					See [IPv6-PREFIXLEN] for further discussion.
				</p>

				<h3 id="section_6_4_6214" > 3.4. Multicast </h3>
				<p>
					RFC 1149 does not specify a multicast address mapping.  It has been
					reported that attempts to implement IPv4 multicast delivery have
					resulted in excessive noise in transmission elements, with subsequent
					drops of packet digests.  At the present time, an IPv6 multicast
					mapping has not been specified, to avoid such problems.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section id="section_7_6214" role="region">
				<h2> 4. Quality-of-Service Considerations </h2>
				<p>
					[RFC2549] is also applicable in the IPv6 case.  However, the author
					of RFC 2549 did not take account of the availability of the
					Differentiated Services model [RFC2474].  IPv6 packets carrying a
					non-default Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) value in their
					Traffic Class field [RFC2460] MUST be specially encoded using green
					or blue ink such that the DSCP is externally visible.  Note that red
					ink MUST NOT be used to avoid confusion with the usage of red paint
					specified in RFC 2549.

					RFC 2549 did not consider the impact on quality of service of
					different types of carriers.  There is a broad range.  Some are very
					fast but can only carry small payloads and transit short distances,
					others are slower but carry large payloads and transit very large
					distances.  It may be appropriate to select the individual carrier
					for a packet on the basis of its DSCP value.  Indeed, different
					carriers will implement different per-hop behaviors according to RFC
					2474.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section id="section_8_6214" role="region">
				<h2> 5. Routing and Tunneling Considerations </h2>
				<p>
					Routing carriers through the territory of similar carriers, without
					peering agreements, will sometimes cause abrupt route changes,
					looping packets, and out-of-order delivery.  Similarly, routing
					carriers through the territory of predatory carriers may potentially
					cause severe packet loss.  It is strongly recommended that these
					factors be considered in the routing algorithm used to create carrier
					routing tables.  Implementers should consider policy-based routing to
					ensure reliable packet delivery by routing around areas where
					territorial and predatory carriers are prevalent.

					There is evidence that some carriers have a propensity to eat other
					carriers and then carry the eaten payloads.  Perhaps this provides a
					new way to tunnel an IPv4 packet in an IPv6 payload, or vice versa.
					However, the decapsulation mechanism is unclear at the time of this 
					writing.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section id="section_9_6214" role="region">
				<h2> 6. Multihoming Considerations </h2>
				<p>
					Some types of carriers are notoriously good at homing.  Surprisingly,
					this property is not mentioned in RFC 1149.  Unfortunately, they
					prove to have no talent for multihoming, and in fact enter a routing
					loop whenever multihoming is attempted.  This appears to be a
					fundamental restriction on the topologies in which both RFC 1149 and
					the present specification can be deployed.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section id="section_10_6214" role="region">
				<h2> 7. Internationalization Considerations </h2>
				<p>
					In some locations, such as New Zealand, a significant proportion of
					carriers are only able to execute short hops, and only at times when
					the background level of photon emission is extremely low.  This will
					impact the availability and throughput of the solution in such
					locations.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section id="section_11_6214" role="region">
				<h2>  8. Security Considerations</h2>
				<p>
					The security considerations of [RFC1149] apply.  In addition, recent
					experience suggests that the transmission elements are exposed to
					many different forms of denial-of-service attacks, especially when
					perching.  Also, the absence of link layer identifiers referred to
					above, combined with the lack of checksums in the IPv6 header,
					basically means that any transmission element could be mistaken for
					any other, with no means of detecting the substitution at the network
					layer.  The use of an upper-layer security mechanism of some kind
					seems like a really good idea.

					There is a known risk of infection by the so-called H5N1 virus.
					Appropriate detection and quarantine measures MUST be available.

					This document requests no action by IANA.  However, registry clean-up
					may be necessary after interoperability testing, especially if
					multicast has been attempted.
